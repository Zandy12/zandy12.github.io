        | Below are a list of projects that I have completed for my Full Stack JavaScript techdegree on www.teamtreehouse.com. The projects range from creating a random number generator to sending AJAX requests to various third-party APIs and retrieving data with JSON. The technologies I have also learned along the way are Node.js and various other frameworks like Express.js and React.js. I also have the developed the skill to debug a complex project on both the client-side and server-side. Feel free to check out the projects on both Github and see the live links! Thank you for your time and interest.
